abstract="There are many WebGL frameworks that are available to abstract away the lower-level application programming interface (API) calls that we have covered in the first six chapters of the book. This abstraction helps to make WebGL development easier and more productive. We will discuss several WebGL frameworks in the next chapter. In this chapter we will concentrate on one of the most widely used frameworks --- Three.js. We will cover the following:A background of the libraryHow to start development with Three.jsFalling back to a 2D canvas context for rendering if WebGL is not supportedThree.js API calls to easily create cameras, objects, and use lighting modelsShow the equivalent Three.js code to some examples found in previous chapters, which used direct low-level WebGL API callsIntroduce tQuery, a library that blends Three.js with jQuery selectors",

abstract="Monitoring data centers is challenging due to their size, complexity, and dynamic nature. This project proposes a visual approach for situational awareness and health monitoring of high-performance computing systems. The visualization requirements are expanded on the following dimensions: (1) High performance computing spatial layout, (2) Temporal domain (historical vs. real-time tracking), and (3) System health services such as temperature, CPU load, memory usage, fan speed, and power consumption. To show the effectiveness of our design, we demonstrate the developed prototype on a medium-scale data center of 10 racks and 467 hosts. The work was developed using feedback from both industrial and acadamic domain experts.",

Database providers can share their pathway data via a common repository. Pathways include biochemical reactions, complex assembly, transport and catalysis events and physical interactions involving proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules and complexes. Pathway Commons aims to collect and integrate all public pathway data available in standard formats. Pathway Commons currently contains data from nine databases with over 1400 pathways.},

abstract ={Despite its wide usage in biological databases and applications, the role of the gene ontology (GO) in network analysis is usually limited to functional annotation of genes or gene sets with auxiliary information on correlations ignored. Here, we report on new capabilities of VisANT?an integrative software platform for the visualization, mining, analysis and modeling of the biological networks?which extend the application of GO in network visualization, analysis and inference. The new VisANT functions can be classified into three categories. (i) Visualization: a new tree-based browser allows visualization of GO hierarchies. GO terms can be easily dropped into the network to group genes annotated under the term, thereby integrating the hierarchical ontology with the network. This facilitates multi-scale visualization and analysis. (ii) Flexible annotation schema: in addition to conventional methods for annotating network nodes with the most specific functional descriptions available, VisANT also provides functions to annotate genes at any customized level of abstraction. (iii) Finding over-represented GO terms and expression-enriched GO modules: two new algorithms have been implemented as VisANT plugins. One detects over-represented GO annotations in any given sub-network and the other finds the GO categories that are enriched in a specified phenotype or perturbed dataset. Both algorithms take account of network topology (i.e. correlations between genes based on various sources of evidence). VisANT is freely available at http://visant.bu.edu.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Many biological processes are context-dependent or temporally specific. As a result, relationships between molecular constituents evolve across time and environments. While cutting-edge machine learning techniques can recover these networks, exploring and interpreting the rewiring behavior is challenging. Information visualization shines in this type of exploratory analysis, motivating the development ofTVNViewer (http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/tvnviewer webcite), a visualization tool for dynamic network analysis.RESULTS:In this paper, we demonstrate visualization techniques for dynamic network analysis by using TVNViewer to analyze yeast cell cycle and breast cancer progression datasets.CONCLUSIONS:TVNViewer is a powerful new visualization tool for the analysis of biological networks that change across time or space.}

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Dynamic visual exploration of detailed pathway information can help researchers digest and interpret complex mechanisms and genomic datasets.RESULTS:ChiBE is a free, open-source software tool for visualizing, querying, and analyzing human biological pathways in BioPAX format. The recently released version 2 can search for neighborhoods, paths between molecules, and common regulators/targets of molecules, on large integrated cellular networks in the Pathway Commons database as well as in local BioPAX models. Resulting networks can be automatically laid out for visualization using a graphically rich, process-centric notation. Profiling data from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus can be overlaid on these networks.CONCLUSIONS:ChiBE's new capabilities are organized around a genomics-oriented workflow and offer a unique comprehensive pathway analysis solution for genomics researchers. The software is freely available at http://code.google.com/p/chibe webcite.}

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:The analysis of large, complex networks is an important aspect of ongoing biological research. Yet there is a need for entirely new, scalable approaches for network visualization that can provide more insight into the structure and function of these complex networks.RESULTS:To address this need, we have developed a software tool named BioFabric, which uses a novel network visualization technique that depicts nodes as one-dimensional horizontal lines arranged in unique rows. This is in distinct contrast to the traditional approach that represents nodes as discrete symbols that behave essentially as zero-dimensional points. BioFabric then depicts each edge in the network using a vertical line assigned to its own unique column, which spans between the source and target rows, i.e. nodes. This method of displaying the network allows a full-scale view to be organized in a rational fashion; interesting network structures, such as sets of nodes with similar connectivity, can be quickly scanned and visually identified in the full network view, even in networks with well over 100,000 edges. This approach means that the network is being represented as a fundamentally linear, sequential entity, where the horizontal scroll bar provides the basic navigation tool for browsing the entire network.CONCLUSIONS:BioFabric provides a novel and powerful way of looking at any size of network, including very large networks, using horizontal lines to represent nodes and vertical lines to represent edges. It is freely available as an open-source Java application.}

    abstract = {<p>A rapidly growing corpus of formal, computable pathway information can be used to answer important biological questions including finding non-trivial connections between cellular processes, identifying significantly altered portions of the cellular network in a disease state and building predictive models that can be used for precision medicine. Due to its complexity and fragmented nature, however, working with pathway data is still difficult. We present Paxtools, a Java library that contains algorithms, software components and converters for biological pathways represented in the standard BioPAX language. Paxtools allows scientists to focus on their scientific problem by removing technical barriers to access and analyse pathway information. Paxtools can run on any platform that has a Java Runtime Environment and was tested on most modern operating systems. Paxtools is open source and is available under the Lesser GNU public license (LGPL), which allows users to freely use the code in their software systems with a requirement for attribution. Source code for the current release (4.2.0) can be found in Software S1. A detailed manual for obtaining and using Paxtools can be found in Protocol S1. The latest sources and release bundles can be obtained from biopax.org/paxtools.</p>},

The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://cbioportal.org) provides a Web resource for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing multidimensional cancer genomics data. The portal reduces molecular profiling data from cancer tissues and cell lines into readily understandable genetic, epigenetic, gene expression, and proteomic events. The query interface combined with customized data storage enables researchers to interactively explore genetic alterations across samples, genes, and pathways and, when available in the underlying data, to link these to clinical outcomes. The portal provides graphical summaries of gene-level data from multiple platforms, network visualization and analysis, survival analysis, patient-centric queries, and software programmatic access. The intuitive Web interface of the portal makes complex cancer genomics profiles accessible to researchers and clinicians without requiring bioinformatics expertise, thus facilitating biological discoveries. Here, we provide a practical guide to the analysis and visualization features of the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics.},

abstract ={A decade ago, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was established at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The original objective of GEO was to serve as a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data generated mostly by microarray technology. However, the research community quickly applied microarrays to non-gene-expression studies, including examination of genome copy number variation and genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins. Because the GEO database was designed with a flexible structure, it was possible to quickly adapt the repository to store these data types. More recently, as the microarray community switches to next-generation sequencing technologies, GEO has again adapted to host these data sets. Today, GEO stores over 20?000 microarray- and sequence-based functional genomics studies, and continues to handle the majority of direct high-throughput data submissions from the research community. Multiple mechanisms are provided to help users effectively search, browse, download and visualize the data at the level of individual genes or entire studies. This paper describes recent database enhancements, including new search and data representation tools, as well as a brief review of how the community uses GEO data. GEO is freely accessible at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/.},

abstract ={The superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is very diverse in  structure and function and its members are among the most pursued targets for  drug development. We identified more than 800 human GPCR sequences and  simultaneously analyzed 342 unique functional nonolfactory human GPCR  sequences with phylogenetic analyses. Our results show, with high bootstrap  support, five main families, named glutamate, rhodopsin, adhesion,  frizzled/taste2, and secretin, forming the GRAFS classification system. The  rhodopsin family is the largest and forms four main groups with 13  sub-branches. Positions of the GPCRs in chromosomal paralogons regions  indicate the importance of tetraploidizations or local gene duplication events  for their creation. We also searched for ?fingerprint? motifs  using Hidden Markov Models delineating the putative inter-relationship of the  GRAFS families. We show several common structural features indicating that the  human GPCRs in the GRAFS families share a common ancestor. This study  represents the first overall map of the GPCRs in a single mammalian genome.  Our novel approach of analyzing such large and diverse sequence sets may be  useful for studies on GPCRs in other genomes and divergent protein  families.},

Compared with other methods of presentation, it is far easier in an icicle plot to read off which objects belong to which clusters, and which objects join or drop out from a cluster as we move up and down the levels of the hierarchy, though these benefits only appear when enough objects are being clustered. Icicle plots are described, and their benefits are illustrated using a clustering of 48 objects.},

The study of these differences can reveal various insights into biological processes and disease progression, especially with the aid of proper tools for network visualization. Toward this purpose, we have developed TVNViewer, a novel visualization tool, which is specifically designed to aid in the exploration and analysis of dynamic networks.Availability: TVNViewer is freely available with documentation and tutorials on the web at http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/tvnviewer.Contact: epxing@cs.cmu.edu},

abstract = {Scagnostics (Scatterplot Diagnostics) were developed by Wilkinson et al. based on an idea of Paul and John Tukey, in order to discern meaningful patterns in large collections of scatterplots. The Tukeys' original idea was intended to overcome the impediments involved in examining large scatterplot matrices (multiplicity of plots and lack of detail). Wilkinson's implementation enabled for the first time scagnostics computations on many points as well as many plots. Unfortunately, scagnostics are sensitive to scale transformations. We illustrate the extent of this sensitivity and show how it is possible to pair statistical transformations with scagnostics to enable discovery of hidden structures in data that are not discernible in untransformed visualizations.},

Scagnostics are characterizations of the 2D distributions of orthogonal pairwise projections of a set of points in multidimensional Euclidean space. These characterizations include such measures as density, skewness, shape, outliers, and texture. We introduce a set of scagnostics measures based on graph theory and we analyze their distributions and performance. Our analysis is based on a restrictive set of criteria that must be met in order to have scagnostics measures that can be used effectively in exploratory data analysis.},

abstract={This paper presents an approach to analyzing two-dimensional temporal datasets focusing on identifying observations that are significant in calculating the outliers of a scatterplot. We also propose a prototype, called Outliagnostics, to guide users when interactively exploring abnormalities in large time series. Instead of focusing on detecting outliers at each time point, we monitor and display the discrepant temporal signatures of each data entry concerning the overall distributions. Our prototype is designed to handle these tasks in parallel to improve performance. To highlight the benefits and performance of our approach, we illustrate and validate the use of Outliagnostics on real-world datasets of various sizes in different parallelism configurations. This work also discusses how to extend these ideas to handle time series with a higher number of dimensions and provides a prototype for this type of datasets.},

abstract = "Historically, our understanding of the soil and assessment of its quality and function has been gained through routine soil chemical and physical laboratory analysis. There is a global thrust towards the development of more time- and cost-efficient methodologies for soil analysis as there is a great demand for larger amounts of good quality, inexpensive soil data to be used in environmental monitoring, modelling and precision agriculture. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy provides a good alternative that may be used to enhance or replace conventional methods of soil analysis, as it overcomes some of their limitations. Spectroscopy is rapid, timely, less expensive, non-destructive, straightforward and sometimes more accurate than conventional analysis. Furthermore, a single spectrum allows for simultaneous characterisation of various soil properties and the techniques are adaptable for ‘on-the-go’ field use. The aims of this paper are threefold: (i) determine the value of qualitative analysis in the visible (VIS) (400–700 nm), near infrared (NIR) (700–2500 nm) and mid infrared (MIR) (2500–25,000 nm); (ii) compare the simultaneous predictions of a number of different soil properties in each of these regions and the combined VIS–NIR–MIR to determine whether the combined information produces better predictions of soil properties than each of the individual regions; and (iii) deduce which of these regions may be best suited for simultaneous analysis of various soil properties. In this instance we implemented partial least-squares regression (PLSR) to construct calibration models, which were independently validated for the prediction of various soil properties from the soil spectra. The soil properties examined were soil pHCa, pHw, lime requirement (LR), organic carbon (OC), clay, silt, sand, cation exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable calcium (Ca), exchangeable aluminium (Al), nitrate–nitrogen (NO3–N), available phosphorus (PCol), exchangeable potassium (K) and electrical conductivity (EC). Our results demonstrated the value of qualitative soil interpretations using the loading weight vectors from the PLSR decomposition. The MIR was more suitable than the VIS or NIR for this type of analysis due to the higher incidence spectral bands in this region as well as the higher intensity and specificity of the signal. Quantitatively, the accuracy of PLSR predictions in each of the VIS, NIR, MIR and VIS–NIR–MIR spectral regions varied considerably amongst properties. However, more accurate predictions were obtained using the MIR for pH, LR, OC, CEC, clay, silt and sand contents, P and EC. The NIR produced more accurate predictions for exchangeable Al and K than any of the ranges. There were only minor improvements in predictions of clay, silt and sand content using the combined VIS–NIR–MIR range. This work demonstrates the potential of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using the VIS, NIR and MIR for more efficient soil analysis and the acquisition of soil information."

Traditionally, elemental analysis of vegetation has been facilitated by acid digestion followed by quantification via inductively coupled plasma (ICP) or atomic absorption (AA) spectroscopy. Previous studies have utilized portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectroscopy to quantify elements in soils, but few have evaluated the vegetation. In this study, a PXRF spectrometer was employed to scan 228 organic material samples (thatch, deciduous leaves, grasses, tree bark, and herbaceous plants) from smelter-impacted areas of Romania, as well as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certified reference materials, to demonstrate the application of PXRF for elemental determination in vegetation. Samples were scanned in three conditions: as received from the field (moist), oven dry (70 °C), and dried and powdered to pass a 2 mm sieve. Performance metrics of PXRF models relative to ICP atomic emission spectroscopy were developed to asses optimal scanning conditions. Thatch and bark samples showed the highest mean PXRF and ICP concentrations (e.g., Zn, Pb, Cd, Fe), with the exceptions of K and Cl. Validation statistics indicate that the stable validation predictive capacity of PXRF increased in the following order: oven dry intact < field moist < oven dried and powdered. Even under field moist conditions, PXRF could reasonably be used for the determination of Zn (coefficient of determination, R2val 0.86; residual prediction deviation, RPD 2.72) and Cu (R2val 0.77; RPD 2.12), while dried and powdered samples allowed for stable validation prediction of Pb (R2val 0.90; RPD 3.29), Fe (R2val 0.80; RPD 2.29), Cd (R2val 0.75; RPD 2.07) and Cu (R2val 0.98; RPD of 8.53). Summarily, PXRF was shown to be a useful approach for quickly assessing the elemental concentration in vegetation. Future PXRF/vegetation research should explore additional elements and investigate its usefulness in evaluating phytoremediation effectiveness."

abstract = "In this paper, we list the goals for and the pros and cons of guidance, and we discuss the role that it can play not only in key low-level visualization tasks but also the more sophisticated model-generation tasks of visual analytics. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly in machine learning, have led to high hopes regarding the possibilities of using automatic techniques to perform some of the tasks that are currently done manually using visualization by data analysts. However, visual analytics remains a complex activity, combining many different subtasks. Some of these tasks are relatively low-level, and it is clear how automation could play a role—for example, classification and clustering of data. Other tasks are much more abstract and require significant human creativity, for example, linking insights gleaned from a variety of disparate and heterogeneous data artifacts to build support for decision making. In this paper, we outline the potential applications of guidance, as well as the inputs to guidance. We discuss challenges in implementing guidance, including the inputs to guidance systems and how to provide guidance to users. We propose potential methods for evaluating the quality of guidance at different phases in the analytic process and introduce the potential negative effects of guidance as a source of bias in analytic decision making."

Previous approaches for exploring large scatter plot spaces like e.g., the well-known Scagnostics approach, mainly focus on ranking scatter plots based on their global properties. However, often local patterns contribute significantly to the interestingness of a scatter plot. We are proposing a novel approach for the automatic determination of interesting views in scatter plot spaces based on analysis of local scatter plot segments. Specifically, we automatically classify similar local scatter plot segments, which we call scatter plot motifs. Inspired by the well-known tf×idf-approach from information retrieval, we compute local and global quality measures based on frequency properties of the local motifs. We show how we can use these to filter, rank and compare scatter plots and their incorporated motifs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with synthetic and real-world data sets and showcase our data exploration tools that visualize the distribution of local scatter plot motifs in relation to a large overall scatter plot space."

The saturated thicknesses are monitored by sensors integrated on wells distributed on a vast geographic area. Our analytics application also captures the trends and patterns (such as average/standard deviation over time, sudden increase/decrease of saturated thicknesses) of water on an individual well and a group of wells based on their geographic locations. To highlight the usefulness and effectiveness of STOAViz, we demonstrate it on the Southern High Plains Aquifer of Texas. The work was developed using feedback from experts at the water resource center at a university. Moreover, our technique can be applied on any geographic areas where wells and their measurements are available.},
